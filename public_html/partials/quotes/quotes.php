				<p>Of all the people I know, Dylan is the most intense and sincere. His emotions are fierce and free, and he cares openly and often. I've never met another person like him and I'm honored to be a part of this milestone in his and Tony's life.</p>

				<p>I have know you for the past 2-3 years.  I must say that there is never a dull moment.  At most its the shade, or in your tearms read, that makes it wonderful.  Nevertheless there is that part of you that I am able to witness.  The amount of joy when you or me talk about cats.  Your appreciation of Scooby-Doo and how a scooby sandwich is always necessary.  But the one true thing that I witness is, when you mention Dylan or talk about Dylan, I can see a different side of you.  Something that is difficult to explain but is wonderful to witness.</p>
